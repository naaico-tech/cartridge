## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- PostgreSQL running on localhost:5432
- Database `cartridge` created
- User `cartridge` with password `cartridge`

### Load Data Automatically
```bash
# Make script executable (if not already done)
chmod +x scripts/load-ecommerce-data.sh

# Run the data loading script
./scripts/load-ecommerce-data.sh
```

### Load Data Manually
```bash
# Load schema
psql postgresql://cartridge:cartridge@localhost:5432/cartridge -f scripts/ecommerce-schema.sql

# Load sample data
psql postgresql://cartridge:cartridge@localhost:5432/cartridge -f scripts/ecommerce-sample-data.sql
```

## üîç Sample Queries

### Basic Counts
```sql
-- Count users
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ecommerce.users;

-- Count products
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ecommerce.products;

-- Count orders
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ecommerce.orders;
```

### Featured Products
```sql
SELECT name, price, stock_quantity 
FROM ecommerce.products 
WHERE is_featured = true;
```

### Product Categories
```sql
SELECT c.name as category, COUNT(p.product_id) as product_count
FROM ecommerce.categories c
LEFT JOIN ecommerce.products p ON c.category_id = p.category_id
GROUP BY c.name
ORDER BY product_count DESC;
```

### Order Analysis
```sql
SELECT 
    status,
    COUNT(*) as order_count,
    AVG(total_amount) as avg_order_value
FROM ecommerce.orders
GROUP BY status;
```

### User Activity
```sql
SELECT 
    u.first_name,
    u.last_name,
    COUNT(o.order_id) as order_count,
    SUM(o.total_amount) as total_spent
FROM ecommerce.users u
LEFT JOIN ecommerce.orders o ON u.user_id = o.user_id
GROUP BY u.user_id, u.first_name, u.last_name
ORDER BY total_spent DESC;
```

## üèóÔ∏è Schema Features

### Indexes
- Performance indexes on frequently queried columns
- Full-text search indexes on product names and descriptions
- Composite indexes for complex queries

### Triggers
- Automatic `updated_at` timestamp updates
- Data integrity constraints

### Extensions
- `uuid-ossp` for UUID generation
- `pg_trgm` for trigram matching (full-text search)

## üîó Connection String

The data is designed to work with this connection string:
```
postgresql://cartridge:cartridge@localhost:5432/cartridge
```

## üìà Data Sources

This sample data is inspired by real e-commerce patterns and includes references from:
- [E-Commerce PostgreSQL Schema](https://github.com/larbisahli/e-commerce-database-schema)
- [Dell Store Example](https://github.com/asotolongo/dell_store)
- [PostgreSQL Guide Example Database](https://www.postgresguide.com/setup/example/)

## üß™ Testing

The data is designed to work with the `cartridge-init` scanner and AI model generation features. You can:

1. **Scan the database** using the scanner API endpoints
2. **Generate dbt models** based on the e-commerce schema
3. **Test AI model generation** with realistic data patterns
4. **Validate analytics** with the included analytics data

## üîß Customization

To customize the data for your needs:

1. **Modify `ecommerce-schema.sql`** to add/remove tables
2. **Update `ecommerce-sample-data.sql`** to change sample data
3. **Adjust connection details** in `load-ecommerce-data.sh`
4. **Add your own data** by extending the sample data file

## üìù Notes

- All UUIDs are pre-generated for consistency
- Passwords are hashed (using bcrypt format)
- Dates are realistic and recent
- Prices are in USD and realistic for the products
- Stock quantities are varied to test inventory scenarios
